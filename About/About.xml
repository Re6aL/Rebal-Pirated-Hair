<description>In every pack there are only a few interesting styles, (unlike my Absolute Legends Hair mod). Carefully selected only the most interesting stuff put together by Яебал, and all the unnecessary stuff deleted/disabled in Defs.
Packs that got my attention:
Odz
Spoons
Rimsenal
O21
Klimhazzard
ChickenMitchell
Galactic
Erins Redux
Accesory
Persona5
...
